# 💼 Resume–Job Matching with Deep Learning

## 🧠 Overview  
This project builds a smart matching system between job descriptions and resumes using natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning.  
By leveraging transformer-based embeddings, it semantically compares resumes with job postings to surface the most relevant matches.

---

## 🔑 Key Features
- 🔍 Semantic matching using Sentence-BERT  
- 🧼 NLP-powered text cleaning for both resumes and job descriptions  
- 📊 Cosine similarity scoring to rank best-fit candidates or jobs  
- 🧠 No manual keyword tuning – purely context-based matching  

---

## 🧰 Technologies
- Python, Pandas, spaCy  
- Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)  
- Scikit-learn, PyTorch  
- Jupyter / Google Colab  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Impact  
This approach offers a scalable and efficient way for recruiters to shortlist candidates and for job seekers to discover well-matched roles — beyond simple keyword overlaps.

---

## 🧪 Demo Options
- Match the top 5 resumes for a given job
- Recommend best-fit job roles for a given resume
